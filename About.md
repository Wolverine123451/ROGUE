About Rogue

A place for all

The idea of Rogue was started by our Dev noticing a complete lack of a Telegram bot eco system in the DeFi Space. 
Now one can argue that there are plenty of telegram bots which do the things Rogue plans to achieve. However, we plan on doing them better, more efficiently and most importantly having them all in the same space. Our planned utilities are only the start, we plan to continue building more products to help our owner community achieve their goals in this space. We plan to build with transparency, authenticity, integrity and most importantly with good old hard work.Â 

That is our promise, that is our mission.
